// Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!

// Your tasks:

// Create an array called bills containing all 10 test bill values.

// Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals (tips and totals)

// Use the calcTip function we wrote before (included in the starter code) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!

// TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, and 52.

// BONUS:

// Write a function calcAverage which takes an array called arr as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it if you feel like it:

// First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable sum that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the sum variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together.

// To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements).

// Call the function with the totals array.

const calcTip = function (bill) {
  return bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
};

/* Write your code below. Good luck! 🙂 */

const bills = [22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, 52];

let tips = [];
let totals = [];

for (let i = 0; i < bills.length; i++) {
  tips[i] = calcTip(bills[i]);
  totals[i] = tips[i] + bills[i];
}

// console.log(tips);
// console.log(totals);

function calcAverage(arr) {
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
    // console.log(sum[i]);
  }
  // console.log(sum);
  console.log(sum / arr.length);
}

calcAverage(totals);
